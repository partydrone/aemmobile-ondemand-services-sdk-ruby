Use this SDK to interface with the Adobe Experience Manager Mobile (AEM Mobile)
On-Demand Services APIs from your Ruby app.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'aemmobile-ondemand-services-sdk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install aemmobile-ondemand-services-sdk

## Prerequisites

### API Key

To access the On-Demand Services API you need to request an API key. To request
the API key, complete the PDF form that is part of the Adobe Experience Manager
Mobile Content Producer Service API file, which can be found [here][api-zip].
Send the completed form to Adobe Developer Support:
[wwds@adobe.com](mailto:wwds@adobe.com).

[api-zip]: https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-publishing-solution/help/integrating-dps.html#downloads

### Generate the `device_id` and `device_token`

Once you receive your API key, generate the `device_id` and `device_token`. Go to
https://aex.aemmobile.adobe.com and do the following:

- Provide the API key
- Sign in with an AdobeID that you requested to whitelist (on the request form)

If all conditions are met, a `device_id` and `device_token` will be generated.

## Configuration

Once you have all the necessary information, you can configure the gem to
communicate with the API:

``` ruby
OndemandServices.configure do |config|
  config.client_id     = 'your-client-id'
  config.client_secret = 'your-client-secret'
  config.device_id     = 'your-device-id'
  config.device_token  = 'your device-token'
end
```

It is highly recommended that you not include your API key and other credentials
directly in your source code. Use `ENV` variables, insteadâ€”especially in a
production environment. If you do not explicitly configure the gem as described
above, it looks for the following environment variables by default:

- `AEMMOBILE_ONDEMAND_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID`
- `AEMMOBILE_ONDEMAND_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AEMMOBILE_ONDEMAND_SERVICES_DEVICE_ID`
- `AEMMOBILE_ONDEMAND_SERVICES_DEVICE_TOKEN`

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
